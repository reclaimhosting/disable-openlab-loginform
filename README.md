# disable-openlab-loginform

This plugin is based on work done by Boone Gorges and [Ed Beck](https://github.com/beckej13820/disable-openlab-loginform). This plugin deactivates Commons in a Box OpenLab's expanding loginbox and modifies the login form in the welcome section of the homepage to simply link to /wp-login.php instead of OpenLab's register form.

This plugin will only be useful to networks running Commons in a Box OpenLab and must be installed in the mu-plugins folder. It was created for schools that are using CBOX OpenLab with SSO and needed to disable the default login methods.

To install place disable-openlab-loginform.php and login.js in the mu-plugins folder.
